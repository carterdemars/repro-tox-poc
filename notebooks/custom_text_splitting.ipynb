      "['1. In Copenhagen in June 1995, an OECD Working Group on Reproduction and Developmental\\nToxicity discussed the need to update existing OECD  Test Guidelines for reproduction and developmental\\ntoxicity and the development of new Guidelines for endpoints not yet covered.  The Working Group\\nrecommended that the Guideline for the Two-generation Reproduction Toxicity Study should be revised,based on proposals received from US and Germany.  The Working Group reached agreement on all major\\nelements of the revised version of this Guideline (1).\\nINITIAL CONSIDERATIONS']\n",
      "['2. This Guideline for two-generation reproduction testing is designed to provide general\\ninformation concerning the effects of a test substance on the integrity and performance of the male and\\nfemale reproductive systems, including gonadal function, the oestrus cycle, mating behaviour, conception,\\ngestation, parturition, lactation, and weaning, and the growth and development of the offspring.  The study\\nmay also provide information about the effects of the test substance on neonatal morbidity, mortality, andpreliminary data on prenatal and postnatal developmental toxicity and serve as a guide for subsequent tests.\\nIn addition to studying growth and development of the F1 generation, this Guideline is also intended to\\nassess the integrity and performance of the male and female reproductive systems as well as growth anddevelopment of the F2 generation.  For further information on developmental toxicity and functionaldeficiencies, either additional study segments can be incorporated into this protocol, utilising the\\nGuidelines for developmental toxicity and/or developmental neurotoxicity, or these endpoints could be\\nstudied in separate studies, using the appropriate Guidelines.\\nPRINCIPLE OF THE TEST']\n",
      "['416 OECD/OCDE\\n2/134. Clinical observations and pathological examinations are performed on all animals for signs of\\ntoxicity with special emphasis on effects on the integrity and performance of the male and female\\nreproductive systems and on the growth and development of the offspring.\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD / PREPARATIONS FOR THE TEST\\nSelection of animal species']\n",
      "['5. The rat is the preferred species for testing.  If other species are used, justification should be given\\nand appropriate modifications will be necessary.  Strains with low fecundity or well-known high incidence\\nof developmental defects should not be used.  At the commencement of the study, the weight variation of\\nanimals used should be minimal and not exceed 20% of the mean weight of each sex.\\nHousing and feeding conditions']\n",
      "['6. The temperature in the experimental animal room should be (22 ± 3)°C.  Although the relative\\nhumidity should be at least 30 % and preferably not exceed 70% other than during room cleaning, the aim\\nshould be 50-60 %.  Lighting should be artificial, the sequence being 12 hours light, 12 hours dark.  For\\nfeeding, conventional laboratory diets may be used with an unlimited supply of drinking water.  The choice\\nof diet may be influenced by the need to ensure a suitable admixture of a test substance when administeredby this method.']\n",
      "['7. Animals may be housed individually or be caged in small groups of the same sex.  Mating\\nprocedures should be carried out in cages suitable for the purpose.  After evidence of copulation, matedfemales shall be single-caged in delivery or maternity cages.  Mated rats may also be kept in small groups\\nand separated one or two days prior to parturition.  Mated  animals shall be provided with appropriate and\\ndefined nesting materials when parturition is near.\\nPreparation of animals']\n",
      "['8. Healthy young animals, which have been acclimated to laboratory conditions for at least 5 days\\nand have not been subjected to previous experimental procedures, should be used.  The test animals should\\nbe characterised as to species, strain, source , sex, weight and/or age.  Any sibling relationships among the\\nanimals should be known so that mating of siblings is avoided.  The animals should be randomly assigned\\nto the control and treated groups (stratification by body weight is recommended).   Cages should be\\narranged in such a way that possible effects due to cage placement are minimised.  Each animal should be\\nassigned a unique identification number.  For the P generation, this should be done before dosing starts.\\nFor the F1 generation, this should be done at weaning for animals selected for mating.  Records indicating\\nthe litter of origin should be maintained for all select ed F1 animals.  In addition, individual identification of\\npups as soon after birth as possible is  recommended when individual weighing of pups  or functional tests\\nare considered.']\n",
      "['OECD/OCDE  416\\n3/13PROCEDURE\\nNumber and sex of animals']\n",
      "['10. Each test and control group should contain a sufficient number of animals to yield preferably not\\nless than 20 pregnant females at or near parturition.  For substances that cause  undesirable treatment\\nrelated effects (e.g. sterility, excessive toxicity at the high dose), this may not be possible.   The objective is\\nto produce enough pregnancies to assure a meaningful evaluation of the potential of the substance to affect\\nfertility, pregnancy and maternal behaviour and suckling, growth and development of the F1 offspring\\nfrom conception to maturity, and the development of their offspring (F2) to weaning.  Therefore, failure to\\nachieve the desired number of pregnant animals (i.e. 20) does not necessarily invalidate the study and\\nshould be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\\nPreparation of Doses']\n",
      "['11. It is recommended that the test substance be administered orally (by diet, drinking water or\\ngavage) unless another route of administration (e.g. dermal or inhalation) is considered more appropriate.']\n",
      "['12. Where necessary, the test substance is dissolved or suspended in a suitable vehicle.  It is\\nrecommended that, wherever possible, the use of an aqueous solution/suspension be considered first,\\nfollowed by consideration of a solution/emulsion in oil (e.g. corn oil) and then by possible solution in other\\nvehicles. For vehicles other than water, the toxic characteristics of the vehicle must be known.  The\\nstability of the test substance in the vehicle should be determined.\\nDosage']\n",
      "['13. At least three dose levels and a concurrent control shall be used.  Unless limited by the\\nphysical-chemical nature or biological effects of the test substance, the highest dose level should be chosen\\nwith the aim to induce toxicity but not death or severe suffering.  In case of unexpected mortality, studieswith a mortality rate of less than approximately 10 percent in the parental (P) animals would normally still\\nbe acceptable.  A descending sequence of dose levels should be selected with a view to demonstrating any\\ndosage related effect and no-observed-adverse-effects level (NOAEL) or doses near the limit of detection\\nthat would allow the determination of a benchmark dose.  Two to four fold intervals are frequently optimal\\nfor setting the descending dose levels and addition of a fourth test group is often preferable to using very\\nlarge intervals (e.g. more than a factor of 10) between dosages.  For the dietary studies the dose interval\\nshould be not more than 3 fold.  Dose levels should be selected taking into account any existing toxicity\\ndata, especially results from repeated dose studies.  Any available information on metabolism and kinetics\\nof the test compound or related materials should also be considered.  In addition, this information will also\\nassist in demonstrating the adequacy of the dosing regimen.']\n",
      "['14. The control group shall be an untreated group or a vehicle-control group if a vehicle is used in\\nadministering the test substance.  Except for treatment with the test substance, animals in the control group\\nshould be handled in an identical manner to the test group subjects.  If a vehicle is used, the control group\\nshall receive the vehicle in the highest volume used.  If a test substance is administered in the diet, andcauses reduced dietary intake or utilisation, then the use of a paired control group may be considered\\nnecessary.  Alternatively data from controlled studies designed to evaluate the effects of decreased food\\nconsumption on reproductive parameters may be used in lieu of a concurrent pair-fed control group.']\n",
      "['416 OECD/OCDE\\n4/13Limit test']\n",
      "['16. If an oral study at one dose level of at least 1000 mg/kg body weight/day or, for dietary or\\ndrinking water administration, an equivalent percentage in the diet or drinking water using the procedures\\ndescribed for this study, produces no observable toxic effects and if toxicity would not be expected based\\nupon data from structurally and /or metabolically related compounds, then a full study using several dose\\nlevels may not be considered necessary.  The limit test applies except when human exposure indicates the\\nneed for a higher oral dose level to be used.  For other types of administration, such as inhalation or dermal\\napplication, the physical chemical properties of the test substance, such as solubility, often may dictate themaximum attainable concentration.\\nAdministration of doses']\n",
      "['17. The animals should be dosed with the test substance on a 7-days-a-week basis.  The oral route of\\nadministration (diet, drinking water, or gavage) is preferred.  If another route of administration is used,\\njustification shall be provided, and appropriate modifications may be necessary.  All animals shall be dosed\\nby the same method during the appropriate experimental period.  When the test substance is administered\\nby gavage, this should be done using a stomach tube.  The volume of liquid administered at one time\\nshould not exceed 1 ml/l00 g body weight (0.4 ml/100 g body weight is the maximum for corn oil), exceptin the case of aqueous solutions where 2 ml/100 g body weight may be used.  Except for irritant or\\ncorrosive substances which will normally reveal exacerbated effects with higher concentrations, variability\\nin test volume should be minimised by adjusting the concentration to ensure a constant volume at all dose\\nlevels.  In gavage studies, the pups will normally only receive test substance indirectly through the milk,\\nuntil direct dosing commences for them at weaning.  In diet or drinking water studies, the pups will\\nadditionally receive test substance directly when they commence eating for themselves during the last\\nweek of the lactation period.']\n",
      "['18. For substances administered via the diet or drinking water, it is important to ensure that the\\nquantities of the test substance involved do not interfere with normal nutrition or water balance.  When the\\ntest substance is administered in the diet either a constant dietary concentration (ppm) or a constant dose\\nlevel in terms of the body weight of the animal may be used; the alternative used must be specified.  For a\\nsubstance administered by gavage, the dose should be given at similar times each day, and adjusted at least\\nweekly to maintain a constant dose level in terms of animal body weight. Information regarding placentaldistribution should be considered when adjusting the gavage dose based on weight.\\nExperimental schedules']\n",
      "['19.Daily dosing of the parental (P) males and females shall begin when they are 5  to 9 weeks old.\\nDaily dosing of the F1 males and females shall begin at weaning; it should be kept in mind that in cases of\\ntest substance administration via diet or drinking water, direct exposure of the F1 pups to the test substance\\nmay already occur during the lactation period.  For both sexes (P and F1), dosing shall be continued for atleast 10 weeks before the mating period.  Dosing is continued in both sexes during the 2 week mating\\nperiod.  Males should be humanely killed and examined when they are no longer needed for assessment of\\nreproductive effects.  For parental (P) females, dosing should continue throughout pregnancy and up to the\\nweaning of the F1\\n offspring.  Consideration should be given to modifications in the dosing schedule based\\non available information on the test substance, including existing toxicity data, induction of metabolism orbioaccumulation.  The dose to each animal should normally be based on the most recent individual body\\nweight determination.  However, caution should be exercised when adjusting the dose during the last\\ntrimester of pregnancy.']\n",

Each day, the females shall be examined for\\npresence of sperm or vaginal plugs.  Day 0 of pregnancy is defined as the day a vaginal plug or sperm arefound.  In case pairing is unsuccessful, re-mating of females with proven males of the same group could be\\nconsidered. Mating pairs should be clearly identified in the data. Mating of siblings should be avoided.\\nF1 mating']\n",
      "['22. For mating the F1 offspring, at least one male  and one female should be selected at weaning from\\neach litter for mating with other pups of the same dose level but different litter, to produce the F2\\ngeneration.  Selection of pups from each litter should be random when no significant differences are\\nobserved in body weight or appearance between the litter mates.  In case these differences are observed,\\nthe best representatives of each litter should be selected.  Pragmatically, this is best done on a body weightbasis but it may be more appropriate on the basis of appearance.  The F1 offspring should not be mated\\nuntil they have attained full sexual maturity.']\n",
      "['23. Pairs without progeny should be evaluated to determine the apparent cause of the infertility.

      "['24. In certain instances, such as treatment-related alterations in litter size or the observation of an\\nequivocal effect in the first mating, it is recommended that the P or F1 adults be remated to produce a\\nsecond litter.

      "['1. The OECD initiated a high -priority activity in 1998 to revise e xisting guidelines and to develop  \\nnew guidelines for the screening and testing of potential endocrine disrupters (1). One element of the  \\nactivity was to develop a Test Guideline for the rat Hershberger  Bioassay. After several decades of use by \\nthe pharmaceutical industry, this assay was first standardized by an official expert committee in 1962 as a \\nscreening tool for androgenic chemicals (2).  In 2001- 2007, t he rat  Hershberger Bioassay has u ndergone an \\nextensive validation programme  including the generatio n of a Background Review Document (23), \\ncompilation of a detailed methods paper (3), development of a dissection guide (21) and the conduct of \\nextensive intra- and interlaboratory studies to show the  reliability and reproducibility of the bioassay .  \\nThese validation studies were conducted  with a potent reference androgen (testosterone propionate (TP)),  \\ntwo potent synthetic androgens (trenbolone acetate and methyl testosterone), a potent antiandrogenic \\npharmaceutical (flutamide), a potent inhibitor of the s ynthesis (finasteride) of the natural androgen \\n(dihydrotestosterone- DHT),  several weakly antiandrogenic pesticides (linuron, vinclozolin, procymidone, \\np,p’ DDE),  a potent 5α  reductase inhibitor (finasteride) and two known negative chemicals (dinitrophenol \\nand nonylphenol) ( 4) (5) (6) (7) (8 ).  This Test Guideline is the outcome of the long historical experience \\nwith the bioassay and the experience gained during the validatio n test programme and the results obtained', 'with the bioassay and the experience gained during the validatio n test programme and the results obtained \\nthere in.']\n",
      "['2. The Hershberger Bioassay is a short -term in vivo  screening test using accessory tissues of the \\nmale reproductive tract. The assay originated in the 1930’s and was modified in the 1940’s to include \\nandrogen- responsive muscles in the male reproductive tract (2) (9- 15).  In the 1960s, over 700 possible \\nandrogens were evaluated using a standardized version of the protocol (2) (14), and use of the assay for both androgens and antiandrogens was considered a standard method in the 1960s (2) (15).  The current \\nbioassay  is based on the changes in weight of five androgen -dependent tissues in the castrate-peripubertal \\nmale rat.  It evaluates the ability of a chemical to elicit biological activities consistent with androgen \\nagonists, antagonists or 5α-reductase inhibitors. The five target androgen -dependent tissues included in this  \\nTest Guideline are the ventral prostate (VP), seminal vesicle (SV) (plus fluids and coagulating glands), \\nlevator ani -bulbocavernosus (LABC) muscle, paired Cowper’s glands (COW) and the glans peni s (GP). In \\nthe castrate-peripub ertal male rat, these five tissues all respond to androgens with an increase in absolute \\nweight. When these same tissues are stimulated to increase in weight by administration of a potent \\nreference andr ogen, these five tissues all respond to antiandrogens with a decrease in absolute weight.  The \\nprimary model for the Hershberger bioassay has been the surgically castrated peripubertal male, which was \\nvalidated in Phases 1, 2 and 3  of the Hershberger validation program.']\n",

      "['4. Due to animal welfare concerns with the castration procedure, the intact (uncastrated) stimulated \\nweanling male was sought as an alternative model for the Hershberger Bioassay to avoid the castration \\nstep. The stimulated weanling test method was validated (24); however, in the validation studies, the \\nweanling version of the Hershberger Bioassay did not appear to be able to consistently detect effects on androgen- dependent organ weights from weak anti -andr ogens at the doses tested.  Therefore, it was not \\nincluded in this Test Guideline.  However, recognising that its use may provide not only animal welfare benefits but also may provide information on other modes of action, it is available in Guidance Docume nt']\n",
      "['115.   \\nINITIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS']\n",
      "['5. Androgen agonists and antagonists act as ligands for the andr ogen receptor and may  activate or \\ninhibit, respectively, gene  transcription controlled by  the receptor.  In addition, some chemicals inhibit the \\nconversion of testosterone to the more potent natural androgen dihydrotestosterone in some androgen \\ntarget tissues ( 5α-reductase inhibitors). Such substances have the  potential to  lead to adverse health \\nhazards, inc luding reproductive and developmental effects. Therefore, the regulatory need  exists to rapidly \\nassess and evaluate a chemical as a possible androgen agonist or antagonist  or 5α -reductase inhibitor .  \\nWhile  informative, the affinity of a ligand for an andro gen r eceptor as measured by receptor binding or \\ntranscriptional activation of reporter genes  in vitro   is not the only determinant of possible hazard. Other \\ndeterminants include metabolic activation and deactivation upon entering the body, substance distri bution \\nto target tissues, and clearance from the body. This leads to the need to screen the possible activity of a \\nchemical in vivo under relevant conditions and exposure . In vivo  evaluation is less critical if the chemical’s \\ncharacteristics regarding Abso rption – Distribution – Metabolism – Elimination (ADME) are known.   \\nAndrogen- dependent tissues respond with rapid and vigorous growth to stimulation by androgens, \\nparticularly in castrate- peripubertal male rats.  Rodent species, particularly the rat, are also widely used in', 'particularly in castrate- peripubertal male rats.  Rodent species, particularly the rat, are also widely used in \\ntoxicity studies for hazard characterization.  Therefore, the  assay version using the castrated peripubertal  \\nrat and the five target tissues in this assay are appropriate for the in vivo screening of androgen agonists \\nand antagonists and 5α -reductase inhibitors.']\n",
      "['6. This Test Guideline is based on those protocols employed in the OECD validation study which \\nhave  been shown to be reliable and reproducible in intra- and interlaboratory studies  (4) (5) (6) (7) (8).  \\nBoth  androgen and anti androgen procedures are  presented in this Guideline.']\n",
      "['7. Although there was some variation in the dose of TP used to detect antiandrogens in the OECD \\nHershberger Bioassay validation programme by the different laboratories (0.2 versus 0.4 mg/kg/d, \\nsubcutaneous injection ) there was little difference between these two protocol variations in the ability to \\ndetect weak or strong antiandrogenic activity. However, it is clear that the dose of TP should not be too \\nhigh as to block the effects of weak androgen receptor (AR) antagonists or so low that the androgenic tissues display little growth response even without antiandrogen coadministration.']\n",
      "['OECD/OCDE             441 \\n \\n3 © OCDE, (2009)  \\n variable effect, because the conversion to more potent dihydrotestosterone varies by tissue.  Antiandrogens \\nthat inhibit 5α− reductase, like finasteride, have more pronounced effects in the ventral prostate than other \\ntissues as compared to a potent AR antagonist, like flutamide. This difference in tissue response can be used to differentiate between AR mediated and 5α− reducta se mediated modes of action. In addition, the \\nandrogen receptor is evolutionarily related to that of other steroid hormones, and some other hormones, \\nwhen administered at high, supraphysiological dosage levels, can bind and antagonize the growth -\\npromoting effects of TP (13). Further, it also is plausible that enhanced steroid metabolism and a \\nconsequent lowering of serum testosterone could reduce androgen -dependent tissue growth. Therefore, any \\npositive outcome in the Hershberger Bioassay should normally be evaluated  using a weight of  evidence \\napproach, including in vitro  assays, such as the AR and estrogen receptor  (ER) binding assays and \\ncorresponding transcriptional activation assays, or from o ther in vivo  assays that examine similar androgen \\ntarget tissu es such as the male pubertal assay , 15- day intact adult male assay,  or 28- day or 90- day repeat \\ndose studies.']\n",

If the purpose is either to obtain a dose-\\nresponse curve or to extrapolate to lower doses, at least 3 dose groups are needed.  If information beyond \\nidentification of androgenic activity (such as an estimate of potency) is required, a different dosing regime should be considered. To test for antiandrogens, the test substance is administered together with a reference \\nandrogen agon ist. A minimum of 3 test groups  with different doses of the test c hemical  and a positive and \\na negative control (See paragraph 44) should be used.  Except for treatment with the test substance, \\nanimals in the control group should be handled in an identical  manner to the test group subjects.

In general, the highest dose should not \\ncause a reduction in the final body weight of the animals greater than 10% of control weight.
